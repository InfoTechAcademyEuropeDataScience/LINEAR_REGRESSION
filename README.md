# HOMEWORK- LINEAR REGRESSION
General Explanation:

Applying Linear Regression Models on a dataset selected from Kaggle

Detailed Explanation:

1- Select a dataset from Kaggle and apply the following models on this dataset.

a) Simple Linear Regression

b) Multiple Linear Regression

c) PCR

d) PLS

e) Ridge

f) Lasso


g) Elastic net

2- Prepare the homework on kaggle.

3- When choosing dataset, take care that the data set must include categorical data and convert these categorical data into numerical data (you can use get_dummies method).

4- Your dataset should be a dataset suitable for the regression problem. (dependent values can be salary, age, score etc.)

5- If the number of data in the data you selected is high, the results will be more accurate.

6- Interpret the results. Evaluate which model works best for your data.

7- Make a presentation on kaggle page.
